# myFlix-App

-within this project, I build a server-side component of a "movies" Web Application. The user can access the application to info about different movies, directors, and genres.

As a user, I want to be able to sign up, update my personal information and be able to create a list of my favorite movies.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

-Node.js
